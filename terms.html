            <p>
                Thanks for choosing Spotify ("Spotify," "we," "us," "our"). Spotify provides personalised services with
                social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and
                services that may be developed from time to time. By signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify
                services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well
                as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the "Spotify
                Service" or "Service"), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made
                available through the Service (the "Content") you are entering into a binding contract with the Spotify
                entity indicated in Section 25 (Contact us).

                Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in
                the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the
                "Agreements"). The Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls,
                automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of
                disputes by arbitration instead of in court. If you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the
                current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify's website. You acknowledge that you
                have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them. If you
                don't agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or
                access any Content.

                In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) meet the age requirements in
                the chart below, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so
                under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in a country or region where Service is available. You also
                promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete,
                and you agree to keep it that way at all times. If you are a resident of one of the following countries
                or regions, reference this chart for your specific age restrictions:

                If your country or region is marked with an asterisk (*) in the chart below, and you require parent or
                guardian consent, your parent or guardian will enter into the contract on behalf of you.
                Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements for valid reasons, such as improving the existing
                functions or features or adding new functions or features to the Service, implementing advancements in
                science and technology, and reasonable technical adjustments to the Service, ensuring the operability or
                the security of the Service, and for legal or regulatory reasons. When we make material changes to the
                Agreements, we'll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a
                prominent notice or seeking your agreement within the Service or by sending you an email. In some cases,
                we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made
                will constitute your acceptance of the changes. Please therefore make sure you read any such notice
                carefully. If you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you
                may terminate your account by contacting us. If you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a
                third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.
