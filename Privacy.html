            <p>
                You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service
                options are available to you when you create a Spotify account. Certain options are provided to you
                free-of-charge. If available in your country or region, the Spotify Service that does not require
                payment is currently referred to as the "Free Service." Other options require payment before you can
                access them (the "Paid Subscriptions"). We may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or
                services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the
                Spotify Service. We are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties. We
                reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional
                offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.

                The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users. We will explain which services are available to
                you when you are signing up for the services. If you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service,
                or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment
                details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service. Note that the Unlimited Service
                may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.

                If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by
                or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription ("Code"), separate terms and conditions
                presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to
                comply with any such terms and conditions. You may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a
                third party. In such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the
                Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.
                You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying
                a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior
                to your purchase; or (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period
                ("Pre-Paid Period").

                Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the
                Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price
                changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes. Price changes will take
                effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. Subject to
                applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change
                takes effect. If you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by
                unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.

                If you register for a Paid Subscription, you may change your mind for any or no reason and receive a
                full refund of all monies paid within the following periods:

                Fourteen (14) days from the day you sign-up for the relevant service, in accordance with the following:
                If you sign up for a Trial, you agree that the Cooling-off Period for the Paid Subscription for which
                you are receiving a Trial is available for fourteen (14) days after you start the Trial. If you don't
                cancel the Paid Subscription before the Trial ends, you authorize Spotify to automatically charge you
                the agreed price each month until you cancel the Paid Subscription.
                If you purchase a Paid Subscription with no Trial, you authorize Spotify to charge you automatically
                each month until you cancel. You agree that the Cooling-off Period is available for fourteen (14) days
                after your purchase but is lost once you use the Spotify Service during that period.
                Seven (7) days from the day you're charged the agreed price each month after the first Paid Subscription
                period, but is lost if you use the Spotify Service during that period.
